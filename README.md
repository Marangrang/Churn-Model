# Churn-Model

Objective:
Develop a predictive model to analyse customer data and predict future buying behaviours or
customer churn. The goal is to leverage data-driven insights to help the company make
informed marketing and sales strategies.

Project Overview:
You are provided with a dataset containing customer information, including purchase history,
online browsing behaviour, demographics, and other relevant features. Your task is to build a
model that can predict whether a customer will make a purchase in the next month or is at risk
of churn.
