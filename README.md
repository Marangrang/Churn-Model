# Churn-Model

## Objective:
Develop a predictive model to analyse customer data and predict future buying behaviours or
customer churn. The goal is to leverage data-driven insights to help the company make
informed marketing and sales strategies.

## Project Overview:
The dataset contains customer information, including purchase history,
online browsing behaviour, demographics, and other relevant features. The task is to build a
model that can predict whether a customer will make a purchase in the next month or is at risk
of churn.

## Data Set Description:
• Customer Demographics: Age, Gender, Income level, etc.
• Purchase History: Dates and amounts of previous purchases, product categories, and
frequency of purchases.
• Online Behavior: Website visit frequency, average session duration, pages viewed.
• Customer Feedback: Ratings, reviews, and feedback from various channels.

## Deliverables:
#### Data Preprocessing and Exploration Report:
• Cleaning and preparing the data.
• Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).

#### Model Development and Validation:
• I explain my choice of algorithm(s) and why they suit this task.
• Described any feature engineering or selection processes I used.
• Validate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.

#### Insights and Recommendations:
• Interpret the model results and provide insights into customer behaviour.
• Offer strategic recommendations based on my findings that could benefit targeted
marketing, personalised offers, or customer retention strategies.

#### Technical Documentation and Code:
• My code is well-documented for your analysis.
• The code is reproducible and explain any assumptions or choices made during
the analysis.
